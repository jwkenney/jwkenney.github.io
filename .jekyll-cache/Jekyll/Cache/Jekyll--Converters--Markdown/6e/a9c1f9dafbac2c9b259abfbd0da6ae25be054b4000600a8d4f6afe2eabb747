<p>After moving into our new house, I found myself in serious need of a wired LAN to handle the gadgets in our living room. I could no longer get away with running cable under the rugs and furniture, and my attempt to go all-wireless turned everything into a Powerpoint presentation. Time to hit the crawlspace and lay down some wire!</p>

<p>I only needed ethernet between two rooms, but I wanted to run them in a way that I could expand on later. Bonus points if it is easy to install in a cramped crawlspace.</p>

<p>Vinyl rain gutters!</p>

<p>For cable management, they have a lot of advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Readily available at home improvement stores, in 10-foot lengths</li>
  <li>Easy to work with- just screw in the brackets, and everything else snaps together</li>
  <li>You can snap in more sections as you extend into other rooms</li>
  <li>No need to fish cables through conduit, or risk pinching them with a staple gun</li>
</ul>

  <p>Note that this is for low-voltage cables only- Iâ€™m sure the NEC has lots to say about the proper way to run electrical wiring.</p>
