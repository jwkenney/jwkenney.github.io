# Cable Management for Home Wiring

After moving into our new house, I found myself in serious need of a wired LAN to handle the gadgets in our living room. I could no longer get away with running cable under the rugs and furniture, and my attempt to go all-wireless turned everything into a Powerpoint presentation. Time to hit the crawlspace and lay down some wire!

I only needed ethernet between two rooms, but I wanted to run them in a way that I could expand on later. Bonus points if it is easy to install in a cramped crawlspace.  

The solution:

Vinyl rain gutters!

For cable management, they have a lot of advantages:

*   Readily available at home improvement stores, in 10-foot lengths
*   Easy to work with- just screw in the brackets, and everything else snaps together
*   You can snap in more sections as you extend into other rooms
*   No need to fish cables through conduit, or risk pinching them with a staple gun

>Note that this is for low-voltage cables only- I'm sure the NEC has lots to say about the proper way to run electrical wiring.
