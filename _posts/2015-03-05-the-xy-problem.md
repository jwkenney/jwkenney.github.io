Have you ever been on the giving or receiving end of an ugly marathon troubleshooting session? One that took so long to resolve, that the solution was found *by accident*? Of course you have, or you wouldn't be reading this. Odds are, you were a casualty of the **XY Problem**.

The XY Problem, as originally explained [here](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem) and paraphrased [here](https://xyproblem.info/):

> * User wants to do X.
> * User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y.
> * User doesn't know how to do Y either.
> * User asks for help with Y.
> * Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.
> * After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.
> The problem occurs when people get stuck on what they believe is the solution and are unable step back and explain the issue in full.

When people call you for help with an issue, *they often want to solve for Y*. In other words, they already have a solution in mind, and they just need your help working out a few details. Unfortunately, one of those details might be that *their solution is entirely unworkable, or else based on flawed knowledge*. Mentioning this fact directly will result in bruised egos at best, or Karen-level confrontations at worst. That is why as the support-giver, you are better off trying to solve for X- that is, get the customer to describe the original problem, and explain what they are trying to achieve with their solution.

That is why when you go to public forums asking for tech support, there is always one annoying-but-correct wiseguy who asks the magic question:

> *What is the problem you are trying to solve?*

There is a downside to having this knowledge. Now that you have a name for this problem, you are going to see it *everywhere*. The upside is that you will also know what to do about it. Just try to think of nice ways to ask the magic question above, because it tends to come across as condescending unless you sugar-coat it.

The same principle applies when you are seeking tech support as well. Try to resist the assumption that you fully understand the problem, or that you already know the best way to solve it. When opening a support case, start by describing your original problem and what your goals are, rather than diving into wherever you left off in your own troubleshooting.
