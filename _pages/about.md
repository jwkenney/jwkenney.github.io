I am a lifelong computer enthusiast... so of course I make a living off of it!

My specialties are:

* Herding Penguins (Linux, mostly RHEL/Ubuntu)
* Storage (EMC, Netapp)
* Virtualization (VMware, OVM, OLVM / oVirt)
* Linux-based infrastructure (storage, compute, load-balancing, virtualization, proxies)
* Automation (Puppet, Ansible)
* Monitoring and observability (Grafana, InfluxDB, logging platforms)
* Disaster recovery
* Not taking life too seriously
