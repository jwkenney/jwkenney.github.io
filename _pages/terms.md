This site is hosted on GithHub Pages, and GitHub's [privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement) applies to your browsing and comment activity on this site. Otherwise, I do not attempt to collect or use your data in any way other than to ensure that this website is functional, and to interpret whatever analytics are gathered on this site via GitHub. I do not attempt to monetize or directly profit from whatever data results from your interactions with this site.

Comments are stored with GitHub, in the site's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jwkenney/jwkenney.github.io/issues) page. The comments are submitted as "issues" via a GitHub-compatible widget called [utterances](https://utteranc.es/). When you click "Log in with GitHub" to submit a comment, you will be authorizing the utterances widget to submit a comment on your behalf. This is equivalent to you browsing to this site's [repository](https://github.com/jwkenney/jwkenney.github.io/) in GitHub, clicking the "Issues" tab, and submitting an issue with your comment. If you need assistance with removing a comment, please contact me and I will help you out.

If you authenticate to submit a comment, the utterances plugin may save a "cookie" within your browsing session, which allows you to make additional comments without authenticating again. I am not aware of any other uses for this cookie.

Other third-party advertisers may place cookies or web beacons into your browsing session, as you browse around the web. This site has no control over these cookies. You can usually disable cookies via your web browser's settings, or else install an ad-blocking or anti-tracking tool. I highly recommend [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/), developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

I do not currently use any additional third-party analytics tools, beacons, etc on this site other than what Github uses.

If you have any questions or concerns, email me at: jameswilliamkenney (at) gmail.com
